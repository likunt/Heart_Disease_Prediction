# Heart_Disease_Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It is therefore necessary to identify the causes and develop a system to predict heart attacks in an effective manner. The dataset has the information about the factors that might have an impact on cardiovascular health. The target field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease. Attribute information is described below:

- restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
- thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
- exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more
- slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- ca - number of major vessels (0-4) colored by flourosopy
- thal - thalium stress result
- target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)
